    In this exercise you have to create a type of class that is really common in OOP: a utility class.

    The first thing you will need to do is to understand what a utility class is and why they exist:

                https://www.baeldung.com/java-helper-vs-utility-classes#java-utility-classes

    Once everything is clear, you will have to:

    1. Build the utility class appropriately.
    2. Implement different functions that perform operation with Bill objects.
